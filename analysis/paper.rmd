## Example of function whatever

As @Adams1986 or someone else stated it is important to be insulted if you do not recognise an even number:

```{r}
iseven(3)
```

Also it is important to have a function which tells you if the number is even:

```{r}
iseven(2)
```


As you can clearly NOT see:

Now in Figure \@ref(fig:funplot) a plot [@Addiscott1977].

```{r funplot, fig.cap="funplot"}
plot(1,1,col="white")
text(1,1,returnname("Pendelhubstichsäge"))
```

```{r}
asd=data.frame(Values=c(1,2,3,4),else=c(2,3,4,5))
pipeme(asd,"val")
```
